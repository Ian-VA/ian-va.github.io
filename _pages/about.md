> “Computer science is not about machines, in
the same way that astronomy is not about
telescopes. There is an essential unity of
mathematics and computer science.” - Edsger W. Dijkstra

I'm a Caltech student majoring in CS, currently working professionally as a software engineer at two startups, [Rogue Avionics](https://rogueavionics.com/) and [Brane Technologies](https://branetechnologies.com/). I like to solve interesting problems and never run out of things to do. 

My professional experience includes working on benchmarking software for the NASA PACE mission at NASA Langley Research Center, writing firmware for avionics circuits, and developing flagship AI products with a focus on video analysis.

I work best when I am given intractable problems and a new knowledge domain to explore. My interests cover everything from machine learning to embedded systems to quantitative finance. I like to keep my mind open and tackle problems within any domain.
