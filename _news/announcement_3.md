After one and a half years of work, I have finished my software internship at NASA Langley Research Center. NASA has truly been a uniquely passionate environment and a wonder to work in. Being a part of its legendary history has been a great honor, and an eye-opening experience that will shape my software for the rest of my life. Thank you to my mentor, Dr. Snorre Stamnes!
